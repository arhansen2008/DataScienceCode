Hello, everyone. This is a quick overview of how to interact with the new interactive worksheet that we're going to try out, so what you're going to do is name-- it doesn't really matter. That's up to you because you're not actually turning this since we're all remote. This first text box is just for you to write in. Just go ahead and write your answer. And what's going to happen is when you submit the final project or the final worksheet, then we'll just go through and read your answers, make sure you have a good understanding of it.       </p>
      <p>
Now, these ones are just dropdowns, so you just click on it and select which one you think is the right answer for it. These ones are also dropdowns, and you're just kind of going through and saying, OK, what does this actually mean, and just selecting not for each one.       </p>
      <p>
Now, this part is where it gets a little weird. For number four, what you're going to do is you're going to select it, and you're going to drag it and drop it up here. And 4A goes to the upper left-hand corner of here. There's two spots. There's an upper left, and there's a bottom left. 4A goes in the upper left part of it while 4B goes to the bottom left of it, so eventually, you should have both of them in there, kind of like that, for all four squares.       </p>
      <p>
And then the last two questions are just like-- the first one, just kind of writing your definition in here and just inserting it. And then when you're done, go and click Finish, and you can say Email My Answers to My Teacher. Check your answers, as well, you can do. The dropdowns and the diagram ones have their correct answers in there, so you can check those to make sure you get it.       </p>
      <p>
And you don't have to submit it for us, but I would suggest, once you check, going through and saving it because then you can-- as a PDF or something because this is a really useful worksheet for you to look at throughout the entire semester to kind of help you nail down that idea of the confusion matrix. But, yeah, so that is kind of how we're doing this.       </p>
      <p>
You can also just print the worksheet and use it like that. There's no issue with that either if you'd rather have that physical copy of it. Or you can even print this once you have it all filled in. So good luck on the worksheet, and I hope this was helpful.       </p>
