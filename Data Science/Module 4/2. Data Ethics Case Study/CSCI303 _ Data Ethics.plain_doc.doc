Hello, data science. I'm no longer in Florida, I'm back in Colorado. Welcome to our ethics unit. It's really important to discuss the societal and ethical implications of using big data. As scientists and engineers, we're doing a lot of work that has possibly a major influence. So we want to make sure to continue to ask those big questions about how our work is going to be used.       </p>
      <p>
I do want to mention, it's not all doom and gloom. However, it is our responsibility to keep in mind the potential impacts of the results of our work and determine if there's any safeguards that need to be put into place. I will explain the project for this week to get you started.       </p>
      <p>
First, you'll watch a Ted Talk. This is by a mathematician and data scientist called Kathy O'Neill. I don't know if you've heard about her, but she wrote a book called Weapons of Math Destruction. She's an interesting and somewhat controversial speaker. Some people agree with her and some not so much, they have contrasting opinions. I like it because it gets us thinking about those big questions and the idea that we should not just have blind faith in our algorithms. It's certainly a great place to start getting those creative juices flowing and feeds into our discussion.       </p>
      <p>
So be sure to take notes as you watch the Ted Talk. You'll be asked to summarize the content and reflect on terms and issues like, should we have these big data integrity checks in place? What is our definition of success? And also think about what are the potential long term effects of our work.       </p>
      <p>
She mentions lots of examples like the value added model that determines of teachers are fired or promoted. Unconscious bias and an example of how they do the blind auditions in the orchestra. And also, there's a really interesting one about the Fox News hiring process.       </p>
      <p>
Then once you're done with the Ted Talk and taking really good notes, you'll research and find another example or issue or a case study and maybe you already know about one. Then what you'll do is you'll create a report, either a paper or a video, on your results and then share this along with a few peer-- peer reviews that you'll provide in this discussion board. So this is all outlined in your data ethics case study assignment page and I really hope you enjoy this assignment as much as I do. Good luck.       </p>
