Hello, everyone. My name is Morgan Cox, and this is a walk-through for setting up Jupyter-- not the planet, notebooks.       </p>
      <p>
So first, let's start by weighing the two options. You have Jupyter Notebook, which will be a local environment on your personal computer, laptop, or desktop. And that just stores everything locally and has all the same functionalities as Jupyter Hub.       </p>
      <p>
Jupyter Hub is an online environment provided by Mines that you have to log into. And you need [INAUDIBLE] or something of that sort, a Mines VPN, in order to be able to use. Either one works just fine. It's however you would prefer to do it.       </p>
